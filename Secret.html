<h1>secret</h1>
<p>I had one of my bad experiences two years ago. I suffered in silence for quite good time.i believed that fixing the problem myself would be a good idea because I knew that people aren’t capable of helping the way i wanted.
Eventually, the secret got spelled out in a public breakdown. They knew.. and their pity weighted on me. I lacked the courage to show my face and wanted to resign the world then of how much shame i felt. I realised due multiple conversations with my people that it wasn’t my fault. I wished i knew before taking that blade i took and create those scars with it. I felt remorse.
Days passed.. one day a stranger asked about details of that burried secret. With so much panic that I couldn’t hide, i asked about the source of their knowledge. They quietly revealed that they overheard it from one of my closest people telling someone else, and that they couldn’t resist but to ask me about it and check if i was okay. Due the mixture of feelings i felt i silently started tearing up. As the pathetic stranger embraced me, reassuring that it wasn’t my fault.
<u>I’m not crying because you knew my secret, but because i trusted the person who you’ve heard it from.</u>
