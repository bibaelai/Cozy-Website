<h1>Eyes Of Nature </h1>
<p> <br>How can I forget ? <br><br>

How can I forget those eyes ? <br><br>
In the chaos of thousands of them, mine only caught hers. I remember them so well, the ones I couldn’t blink while looking at. Soft light brown, the ones that have a loud shine in the dark, that turns sunlight into warmth.
She has those eyes that whispers “slow down” in a room full of rush. And why rushing when those eyes are inviting me to a whole new world ? A world of nature, old books and music, a world where peace breathes softly. <br>
They reminded me of coffee; brown, warm, deep. but now coffee reminds me of them, or perhaps, of her.
She clearly doesn’t realize the power she has, on me at least. I admit ! <br>
And whenever I dare to look away, my gaze clings to her hair.. That brown hair finishing the fantasy her eyes had begun. Every curl tells a story as if they were alive, every movement takes my breath. I watched them falling, spiraling, dancing softly in the air. As if they were showing their gratitude to be a part of her. NADA, her name was…
I forever thought that NADA means nothing (in Spanish) but after what I’ve seen and from now on, N-A-D-A means a lot… a lot more than my pen could write.
