<h1>Pouring Thoughts</h1>
<p>Loneliness is not the absence of people, it’s the presence of silence in a room full of voices, being seen but not heard.<br> I’ve known solidarity for years, embraced it even, knowing full well the risk of loneliness. And yet, I still walked into it willingly. I came to this city in search of growth, knowledge and a lot more. I want to know the real meaning of life and I admit that I enjoy the life’s hardships in this experience cause I know that I’ll end up learning a lot. In this place, I found people I cannot bring myself to love. Their words are shallow, their kindness fleeting, their loyalty as fragile as glass. Still, I tried. I let myself believe that connection was possible, that somewhere in the sea of unfamiliar faces, I had found one that was comforting. It was her, the one that I trusted, defended and loved. The only one that I felt myself with.
I woke up to them whispering my name, I gently opened my eyes with a smile that took over my face. Speechless I got…
I found out that it was a nightmare or that’s what I like to call it to escape the painful truth. the whispers weren’t directed at me, I could hear my name come of the lips of the person I thought was there for me but in a table full of faces I couldn’t recognize, their faces were distorted. I could clearly hear what they said and for a moment I thought my ears were ill. I could hear my secrets, my weaknesses with a mixture of rumors slipping out of their tongue. the whispers aren’t whispers anymore, it was getting louder and louder, the last thing I heard is a harsh pop in both of my ears followed by a feeling of a warm liquid coming out of them. I stayed quiet for a very long time. The realization settled deep in my chest like a sickness. How easily they had smiled at me while sharpening their words behind my back. How effortlessly they had taken my trust, my loyalty, and used them against me. I keep asking myself if betraying me was actually as easy as breathing pure air? Every time my eyes catches a mirror I can see my ears getting longer, just like that animal. I’m not going to denny that I avoid looking at my face. I know but can’t accept the truth that that person is the same that I defended and fought for whenever others try to warn me about them. But now, I only fight against myself.. Against the disappointment that clings to me like a second skin. Against the guilt of believing in something that was never real. Against the restless nights, where the weight of regret presses into my chest, making sleep impossible.
Four nights have passed, and the silence has grown louder. I ask myself again and again ; was I blind, or just desperate for connection? Was I wrong to trust, or was it simply my fate to learn this lesson the hard way?
I don’t know what hurts more, the betrayal itself or the fact that, despite everything, a part of me still longs for the person I thought they were. Maybe that is the cruelest part of all not the lies they told, but the ones I told myself.
